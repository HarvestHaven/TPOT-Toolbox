    title: 'Harvest Haven Pastured Poultry – Free Range Living',
    description: 'Harvest Haven laying hens, broilers, and turkeys are truly pasture raised and free range.  Our birds are in the pasture during the growing season where they get to scratch, hunt for bugs, and eat all the greens they want.\nIf there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that healthy birds need lots of sunlight and salad. And if a chicken or a turkey doesn’t have the ability and freedom to express every part of its scratchy, diggy little personality, something’s wrong with how they’re being raised.'

    description: 'In this video, Martin explains where salmonella originates and why free-range poultry produces risk-free eggs and meat.\nHe also discusses why grass-fed meats are safe. It’s the grain-fed livestock in feedlots (CAFOs – Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) that’s the problem. No amount of government intervention will help if it doesn’t address the issue of how the animals are raised.'

    description: 'There’s more to “grass-fed” than free-range animals eating grass on a large pasture. Martin Van Popta, manager at Harvest Haven, explains the importance of moving cattle daily to small pastures with a rich variety of grasses and a constant source of fresh water.\nThis system of small grazing blocks on a daily rotation works perfectly for the pasture, the cattle, and the farmer, and it provides excellent grass-fed beef for your eating pleasure.'

    description: 'Our little layer chicks are in a portion of the hen house separated from the big girls. They have wooden brooder boxes with heat lamps to keep them warm like a mother hen. We call these “wooden hens.”\nThe other morning when James came into the hen house, he heard loud cheeping coming from behind a feeder. Investigating the source with his cell phone camera rolling, James shared his discovery.\nIt’s an amazing scene. You hear the loud cheeping but can’t see what’s making it. The hens are quizzically looking in the direction of this unusual sound; weird hair-do hen stretches her neck to see better, but not get too close; then, out pops a chick from behind the feeder.\nJames, “What are you doing here? How did you get over here?”\nThe little guy comes towards him and then takes off in the other direction, cheeping frantically.\nWhen it disappears behind the big red hen, you hold your breath anticipating the worst – nasty pecks from another hen.\nBut, what a wonderful surprise! The hen tucks the little guy between her legs, protecting it. Then, proceeds to show it how to peck for food. How lovely!'
